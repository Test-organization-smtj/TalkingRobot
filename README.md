# TalkingRobot

In this project we will try to train a NLP model with videos/Scripts/Audios to answer a question provided by human in a best possible way. The model should learn in a Deep Reinforcement Learning method as well. The project is planned to execute in conventional 4 main steps, 
  1. Selecting a model
  2. Finding a data set
  3. Training the selected training model
  4. Testing

## Sahan Mendis: I have a strong feeling that a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning can be used here.
