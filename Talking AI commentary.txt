-- Talking AI (an AI which can understand and react to speach or do both at the same time) --

-- The AI should,
1) Understand speach
2) Give responses for speach

3) or do both at the same time (I think this is more straight forward method because human
thought process is also a real time action and reaction sequence than storing data, processing etc.
Just think why there is the internal voice working non-stop? Because we are providing responses to 
even the internal speach.

I think the third option should be the starting point. Shall we start doing small projects and review
on the progress?
